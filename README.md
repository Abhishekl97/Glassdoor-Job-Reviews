# Glassdoor Job Reviews in Python

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Glassdoor job reviews to extract insights about companies' work environments, cultural values, and overall employee satisfaction. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and building a predictive model using linear regression.
